📚 I am an incoming first year Masters in Computer Science student at Carnage Melon University. I plan to focus my coursework at CMU on Machine Learning Theory & Systems.

💼 This summer, I am working as an Applied Scientist Intern at [harpin AI](https://harpin.ai) where I am applying Deep Learning to improve the companies core identity profile similarity model.

🎓 This past June, I graduated from Dartmouth College Summa Cum Laude with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. 

🔬 While at Dartmouth, I worked as a Deep Learning Researcher at the [Minds, Machines and Society Group](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) where my work focused on Interpretability and Preventing Bias in Large Language Models. I was lucky to have two excellent advisors in [Soroush Vosoughi] (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=45DAXkwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yoaqing Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangyaoqingcmu/)!
