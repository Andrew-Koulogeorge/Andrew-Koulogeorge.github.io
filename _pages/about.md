üìö¬†I am a first-year Master in Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am focusing my study at Carnegie Mellon on Machine Learning.

‚≠ê My research on Bridging the Faithfulness Gap in Prototypical Models was just accepted for an oral presentation at the [Workshop on Insights From Negative Results](https://insights-workshop.github.io) @ NAACL (2025). Preprint will be available soon!

üì± This summer, I will be interning at [AppLovin](https://www.applovin.com) in Palo Alto working on developing state of the art recommendation systems. 

üíº This past summer, I worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at [harpin AI](https://harpin.ai) where I applied Neural Networks and Text Embedding Models to improve the companies core identity profile similarity model. I was very fortunate to be mentored by [Max De Jong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxwelldejong/) and [Wenzhong Zhao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenzhong-zhao-780a115/).

üå≤ Last June, I graduated from Dartmouth College Summa Cum Laude with a major in Mathematics. 

üî¨ While at Dartmouth, I worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at the [Minds, Machines and Society Group](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) where my work focused on improving interpretability and preventing bias in Large Language Models. I was lucky to have two excellent advisors in [Soroush Vosoughi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=45DAXkwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yaoqing Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangyaoqingcmu/)!


### From Spreadsheets to Tech
Pursuing Machine Learning was far from my original plan. When I arrived at Dartmouth, I initially majored in economics with a focus on a career in finance. I participated in the [Tuck Bridge](https://bridge.tuck.dartmouth.edu) program during my sophomore year and interned as a Technology Mergers & Acquisitions analyst at [Moelis & Company](https://www.moelis.com) over my Junior Summer at Dartmouth. While I greatly appreciated the experience and the people I worked with at Moelis, I ultimately decided not to accept a full-time offer and instead chose to attend Carnegie Mellon to follow the passion I had developed at Dartmouth for Math, Computer Science, and Machine Learning.
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
