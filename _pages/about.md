📚 I am an incoming first year Masters in Computer Science student at Carnage Melon University. I plan to focus my coursework at CMU on Machine Learning Theory & Systems.

💼 This summer, I am working as an Applied Scientist Intern at harpin AI where I am applying Deep Learning to improve the companies core identity profile similarity model.

🎓 This past June, I graduated from Dartmouth College Summa Cum Laude with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. While at Dartmouth, I worked as a Deep Learning Researcher at the Minds, Machines and Society Group where my work focused on Interpretability and Bias in Large Language Models. I was lucky to have two excellent advisors in Soroush Vosoughi and Yoaqing Yang!
