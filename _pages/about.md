📚 I am a second-year Master in Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am focusing my study at Carnegie Mellon on Machine Learning.

📌 This fall, I was a Machine Learning Engineering Intern at Pinterest in the Advanced Technology Group (ATG) working on Pre-training & Efficient Fine-tuning for Pinterest's Foundation Model.

📱 This summer, I interned at [AppLovin](https://www.applovin.com) in Palo Alto where I trained Neural Networks for impression bid prediction.

🪪 I also worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at [harpin AI](https://harpin.ai) where I applied Neural Networks and Text Embedding Models to improve the companies core identity profile similarity model.

🌲 I graduated my undergrad from Dartmouth College Summa Cum Laude in mathethmatics

🔬 While at Dartmouth, I worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at the [Minds, Machines and Society Group](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) where my work focused on improving interpretability and preventing bias in Large Language Models. I was lucky to have two excellent advisors in [Soroush Vosoughi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=45DAXkwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yaoqing Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangyaoqingcmu/)!


### Other Stuff
I started as an econ major and I did a stint in Investment Banking at [Moelis & Company](https://www.moelis.com) during my junior summer of undergrad. The people and culture at Moelis were fantastic but the work wasn't for me
