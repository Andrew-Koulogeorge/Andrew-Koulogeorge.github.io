📚 I am a first year Masters in Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am focusing my coursework at Carnegie Mellon on Machine Learning Theory & Machine Learning Systems.

💼 This summer, I worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at [harpin AI](https://harpin.ai) where I applied Neurel Networks to improve the companies core identity profile similarity model. I was very fortunate to be mentored by [Max De Jong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxwelldejong/) and [Wenzhong Zhao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenzhong-zhao-780a115/).

🎓 This past June, I graduated from Dartmouth College Summa Cum Laude in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

🔬 While at Dartmouth, I worked as a Deep Learning Researcher at the [Minds, Machines and Society Group](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) where my work focused on Interpretability and Preventing Bias in Large Language Models. I was lucky to have two excellent advisors in [Soroush Vosoughi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=45DAXkwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yoaqing Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangyaoqingcmu/)!

🔍 I am actively looking for internship opportunities in Machine Learning & Software Development for Summer 2025!
