## Self Study:

**Stanford CS234: Reinforcement Learning**

Completed projects from Stanford Reinforcement Learning [CS234](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/) by watching online lectures and reading the free Sutton & Barto textbook. My code and theoretical analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/Andrew-Koulogeorge/CS234-Reinforcement-Learning).
