## Self Study:

**CMU 10714: Deep Learning Systems**

 See [here](https://github.com/Andrew-Koulogeorge/Needle). Very useful material to understand for any DL researcher or practioner. 

**Stanford CS234: Reinforcement Learning**

Completed projects from Stanford Reinforcement Learning [CS234](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/) by watching online lectures and reading the free Sutton & Barto textbook. My code and theoretical analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/Andrew-Koulogeorge/CS234-Reinforcement-Learning). My motivation for studying this was that RL is used a lot in sota LLM post training and I wanted to at least know the basics
